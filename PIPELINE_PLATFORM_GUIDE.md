## üéØ Understanding Pipeline Metrics

### Pipeline Value
```
Total Value = Sum of all deal values
```
This is the "best case" scenario if all deals close.

### Weighted Forecast
```
Weighted Value = Sum of (Deal Value √ó Probability / 100)
```
This is the realistic forecast based on deal confidence.

**Example:**
- Deal A: R 1,000,000 at 70% = R 700,000 weighted
- Deal B: R 500,000 at 30% = R 150,000 weighted
- **Weighted Forecast: R 850,000**

### Average Deal Size
```
Avg Deal Size = Total Pipeline Value / Number of Deals
```
Helps identify deal patterns and set targets.

### Deal Age Tracking
```
Age = Current Date - Created Date (in days)
```
**Why it matters:**
- **New deals** (‚â§7d): Need immediate attention
- **Active deals** (8-30d): Normal progression
- **Aging deals** (31-60d): May need re-engagement
- **Stale deals** (>60d): Risk of going cold - urgent action needed
