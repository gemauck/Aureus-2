# Performance Fix - Excessive Re-renders in Kanban Drag-and-Drop

## Issue ❌

**Problem:** "Persis
tence is stretchy as hell" - Lead and opportunity stage changes were working, but the Kanban board was triggering **excessive reloads** causing poor performance.

**Root Cause:** Line 1044 in `src/components/clients/Clients.jsx` was calling `setRefreshKey(k => k + 1)` after every drag-and-drop operation, which:
1. Triggered the `useEffect` at line 380 (which depends on `refreshKey`)
2. Called `loadClients()` and `loadLeads()` 
3. Caused full data reloads from the API
4. Created a cascade of re-renders

## The Fix ✅

**Location:** `src/components/clients/Clients.jsx` line 1044

**Change:** Removed the unnecessary `setRefreshKey(k => k + 1)` call after drag-and-drop operations.

**Why It Works:**
1. Local state is already updated immediately (optimistic updates)
2. API call is already made to persist the change
3. No need to trigger a full reload
4. Eliminates the cascade of re-renders

```javascript
// BEFORE (Performance Killer):
setDraggedItem(null);
setDraggedType(null);
setRefreshKey(k => k + 1); // ❌ Triggers full reload

// AFTER (Optimized):
setDraggedItem(null);
setDraggedType(null);
// No need to trigger full reload - state already updated and API call made
```

## Result

- ✅ Data still persists correctly to database
- ✅ No more excessive API calls
- ✅ Smooth drag-and-drop experience
- ✅ Performance dramatically improved

## Testing

Drag leads between stages - you should see:
1. Smooth animations without lag
2. Stage changes persist
3. Minimal console logs (no cascade of `loadClients` calls)
4. Overall faster, more responsive UI
