1. **Go to:** https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
2. **Click:** "Verify a Single Sender"
3. **Enter:** `garethm@abcotronics.co.za`
4. **Complete the form** and verify via email

### After Verification

1. Test again: `node test-admin-email.js`
2. Submit feedback through the widget
3. Check your inbox for notifications

## 🔍 Verify System is Working

When you submit feedback, check your server logs. You should see:
