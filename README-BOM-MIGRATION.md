# BOM Inventory Item Integration - Complete & Ready

## ‚úÖ All Changes Complete

All code changes have been implemented and are **backward compatible**. Your server will **NOT break**.

### What Was Changed

1. **Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
   - Added `inventoryItemId` field to BOM model (nullable - safe!)
   - Added relation between BOM and InventoryItem

2. **API** (`api/manufacturing.js`)
   - BOM creation requires `inventoryItemId` (new BOMs only)
   - Work order completion automatically adds finished goods to inventory
   - **Backward compatible**: Old BOMs work via SKU fallback

3. **UI** (`src/components/manufacturing/Manufacturing.jsx`)
   - BOM form requires selecting finished product inventory item
   - Auto-fills Product SKU and Name from selection

## üöÄ To Apply Migration (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Prisma Migrate (Recommended)
```bash
# Generate and apply migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_bom_inventory_item

# If that doesn't work, try:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Method 2: Safe Migration Script
```bash
# Make sure DATABASE_URL is set in .env
./apply-bom-migration-safe.sh
```

### Method 3: Manual SQL (If you have direct DB access)
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f add-bom-inventory-item-migration.sql
```

## üîí Safety Guarantees

‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing BOMs continue working  
‚úÖ **Nullable Field**: `inventoryItemId` is optional (NULL allowed)  
‚úÖ **Fallback Logic**: Old BOMs use SKU-based lookup  
‚úÖ **Server Safe**: Code handles missing `inventoryItemId` gracefully  

## üìã What Happens

### Before Migration
- Everything works as before
- No changes to existing functionality

### After Migration
- ‚úÖ Existing BOMs: Continue working (can be viewed/edited)
- ‚úÖ New BOMs: Must select inventory item (UI enforces this)
- ‚úÖ Work Orders: Completed orders add finished goods to inventory automatically
- ‚úÖ Cost Tracking: Finished goods carry cost = sum of parts

## üß™ Testing After Migration

1. **Check existing BOMs still load**: Go to Manufacturing ‚Üí BOMs tab
2. **Create new BOM**: Should require inventory item selection
3. **Complete work order**: Should add finished goods to inventory
4. **Check inventory**: Finished goods should appear with correct cost

## üìù Migration SQL (for reference)

The migration adds:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "BOM" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "inventoryItemId" TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "BOM_inventoryItemId_idx" ON "BOM"("inventoryItemId");
```

This is **safe** because:
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` (won't fail if already exists)
- Column is nullable (existing rows get NULL)
- No data loss

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

The migration is **reversible**:
```sql
-- Rollback (only if needed)
ALTER TABLE "BOM" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "inventoryItemId";
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "BOM_inventoryItemId_idx";
```

But you shouldn't need to - the migration is designed to be safe!

## ‚úÖ Status

**Ready to deploy!** All code is backward compatible and safe.
