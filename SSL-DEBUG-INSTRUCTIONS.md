# SSL "Not Secure" Issue - Debug Instructions

## The Issue
Your site shows "Not Secure" in browser when accessing `https://abcoafrica.co.za`

## What We Verified
‚úÖ Server has valid Let's Encrypt certificate  
‚úÖ Certificate is valid until Jan 25, 2026  
‚úÖ Full certificate chain is present  
‚úÖ Nginx is configured correctly  
‚úÖ HSTS headers are enabled  

The server-side SSL is working perfectly.

## Browser Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check the Exact Warning
In your browser:
1. Visit `https://abcoafrica.co.za`
2. Look at the address bar
3. Is there:
   - üîí Green padlock with "Secure"
   - üîì Padlock with slash "Not secure"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning triangle
   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info icon

**Please tell me which one you see**

### Step 2: Check Certificate Details
1. Click on the lock/info icon in address bar
2. Click "Certificate" or "View certificates"
3. Take a screenshot of the certificate details

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Copy any errors you see

### Step 4: Check Network Tab for Mixed Content
1. In DevTools, go to Network tab
2. Reload the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. Look for any resources with:
   - Red X icon
   - Orange triangle warning
   - Failed status (red)
4. Click on any failed resources
5. Check if they're trying to load over HTTP

### Step 5: Test in Different Mode
1. Open a new **Incognito/Private** window
2. Visit `https://abcoafrica.co.za`
3. Does it still show "Not Secure"?

If "Not Secure" goes away in incognito, it's a cache issue.

### Step 6: Check Which Browser You're Using
Please tell me:
- Browser name (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Version number

## Common Causes and Solutions

### Cause 1: Browser Cache (Most Common)
**Symptom**: Works in incognito but not in normal window

**Solution**:
```bash
Chrome/Edge:
1. Ctrl+Shift+Del (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Del (Mac)
2. Select "All time"
3. Check: Cookies, Cached images and files
4. Click "Clear data"

Firefox:
1. Ctrl+Shift+Del
2. Select "Everything"
3. Check: Cookies, Cache
4. Click "Clear Now"
```

### Cause 2: Mixed Content
**Symptom**: Page has resources loading over HTTP

**Solution**: Check Network tab for HTTP resources and fix them

### Cause 3: Old Certificate Cached
**Symptom**: Certificate details show expired or self-signed

**Solution**:
1. Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data
2. Select "Advanced" tab
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"

## Quick Tests to Run

### Test 1: Check SSL Labs Rating
Visit this URL in your browser:
```
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=abcoafrica.co.za
```

This will show you what SSL Labs sees (it may take 1-2 minutes to complete).

### Test 2: Check from Command Line (Mac)
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
openssl s_client -connect abcoafrica.co.za:443 </dev/null 2>&1 | grep "Verify return code"
```

Should show: `Verify return code: 0 (ok)`

### Test 3: Try Different Browser
Try accessing `https://abcoafrica.co.za` in:
- Chrome
- Firefox  
- Safari
- Edge

Do they all show "Not Secure" or just one?

## What I Need From You

Please provide:

1. **Screenshot** of the browser showing "Not Secure"
2. **Browser** and version
3. **Certificate details** (screenshot from Step 2)
4. **Console errors** (from Step 3)
5. **Any failed resources** in Network tab (from Step 4)
6. **Does it work in incognito?** (from Step 5)

## Most Likely Solution

Based on the symptoms, this is probably a **browser cache issue**. Try:

1. Close the browser completely
2. Clear all browsing data
3. Restart the browser
4. Visit `https://abcoafrica.co.za` again

Or simply wait 24 hours - the HSTS (security header) will update browsers gradually.

## Current Server Status

Your server is correctly configured:
- ‚úÖ Valid SSL certificate
- ‚úÖ Full certificate chain
- ‚úÖ Modern TLS protocols (1.2, 1.3)
- ‚úÖ Security headers enabled
- ‚úÖ HSTS enabled

The issue is likely browser-side, not server-side.
