# Quick Railway OpenSSL Fix

## The Problem
Your Railway deployment is failing because of Prisma OpenSSL compatibility issues. The logs show:
```
Error loading shared library libssl.so.1.1: No such file or directory
```

## The Solution
I've fixed the Prisma configuration to work with Railway's Alpine Linux environment.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Login to Railway CLI
```bash
railway login
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
```bash
railway variables set JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
railway variables set NODE_ENV="production"
railway variables set APP_URL="https://abco-erp-2-production.up.railway.app"
```

### 3. Deploy the Fix
```bash
railway up
```

### 4. Run Database Setup
```bash
railway run npx prisma db push
railway run node fix-railway-login.js
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Prisma Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):
   - Added correct binary targets for Railway's Alpine Linux
   - Fixed database provider to PostgreSQL
   - Added `linux-musl` and `linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x` targets

2. **Enhanced Login Endpoint** (`api/auth/login.js`):
   - Better error handling and logging
   - Database connection testing
   - JWT secret validation

3. **Health Check** (`api/health.js`):
   - Database connection testing
   - Admin user verification
   - Environment variable validation

4. **Admin User Script** (`fix-railway-login.js`):
   - Creates admin user with correct credentials
   - Tests database connection
   - Validates password hashing

## Expected Results

After running these commands:
- ✅ No more Prisma OpenSSL errors
- ✅ Database connection successful
- ✅ Login works with admin@abcotronics.com / admin123
- ✅ Health endpoint shows all systems OK

## Test Your Fix

1. Visit: `https://abco-erp-2-production.up.railway.app/api/health`
2. Should show: `"database": "connected"` and `"admin_user": "exists"`
3. Try logging in with:
   - Email: `admin@abcotronics.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Check Railway logs:
```bash
railway logs
```

Look for any remaining Prisma or database errors and let me know what you see.
