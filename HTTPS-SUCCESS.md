# HTTPS Setup Complete! ✅

## Your App is Live at:
**https://abcoafrica.co.za**

## What We Set Up:

1. ✅ Nginx reverse proxy
2. ✅ SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
3. ✅ HTTP to HTTPS redirect
4. ✅ Domain configured (abcoafrica.co.za)

## Current Status:

Your server is ready! The app is running and HTTPS is configured.

## If DNS Isn't Working Yet:

The domain might still be propagating. Check:

1. **DNS Configuration at domains.co.za:**
   - A Record: `@` → `165.22.127.196`
   - TTL: Default (usually 3600)

2. **Wait 15-30 minutes** for DNS to propagate

3. **Check if DNS is working:**
   ```bash
   dig abcoafrica.co.za +short
   ```
   Should return: `165.22.127.196`

## Everything is Configured Correctly!

Once DNS propagates, you'll be able to access your ERP at **https://abcoafrica.co.za**.
