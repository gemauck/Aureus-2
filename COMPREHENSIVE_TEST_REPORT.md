# Comprehensive Test Report
## ERP System Production Fixes and Testing

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Environment**: Production (Railway)  
**Base URL**: https://abco-erp-2-production.up.railway.app

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Successfully identified and fixed critical production issues in the ERP system. Database schema has been updated, API routing logic has been corrected, and comprehensive fixes have been deployed to production.

### Status: ✅ **Fixes Deployed - Waiting for Propagation**

---

## 📋 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. API Routing Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: API endpoints (`/api/leads`, `/api/projects`, `/api/invoices`, `/api/time-entries`) were returning HTML instead of JSON  
**Root Cause**: URL path parsing mismatch between server routing and API handlers  
**Solution**: Updated server.js and all API endpoint handlers to use consistent URL parsing

**Files Modified**:
- `server.js` - Fixed `toHandlerPath()` function
- `api/leads.js` - Updated path segment checking
- `api/projects.js` - Updated path segment checking
- `api/invoices.js` - Updated path segment checking  
- `api/time-entries.js` - Updated path segment checking

### 2. Database Schema Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Missing TimeEntry model and field name conflicts  
**Root Cause**: Database schema was incomplete and had duplicate field names

**Solution**: Complete database schema overhaul
- Added `TimeEntry` model for time tracking functionality
- Fixed duplicate field names:
  - `Project.client` → `Project.clientName`
  - `Project.tasks` → `Project.tasksList`
  - `Invoice.client` → `Invoice.clientName`
  - `TimeEntry.project` → `TimeEntry.projectName`
- Added missing fields to `Client` model: `value`, `probability`

**Database Migration**: Successfully applied with `prisma db push`

### 3. Storage Functions ✅ VERIFIED
**Problem**: Frontend components reported missing storage functions  
**Solution**: All storage functions (`getProjects`, `getTeamDocuments`, `getEmployees`, etc.) are properly defined in `localStorage.js`

### 4. Server Configuration ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: Static file serving wasn't optimized  
**Solution**: Enhanced static file serving with proper caching headers

## 📊 Database Schema

### Updated Models:

```prisma
✅ User          - User authentication and management
✅ Team          - Team organization
✅ Membership    - User-team relationships
✅ Client        - Clients and leads (with value, probability)
✅ Project       - Project management (with fixed field names)
✅ Opportunity   - Sales opportunities
✅ Invoice       - Invoice management (with fixed field names)
✅ Task          - Task management with subtasks
✅ TimeEntry     - **NEW** Time tracking
✅ AuditLog      - Audit trail
✅ Invitation    - User invitations
```

### Key Schema Changes:
- ✅ Added `TimeEntry` model
- ✅ Fixed all field name conflicts
- ✅ Added `value` and `probability` to `Client`
- ✅ Made relationships optional where needed
- ✅ Added proper defaults for all fields

## 📝 Technical Details

### API Routing Fix
```javascript
// Before (Incorrect)
const url = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`)
const pathSegments = url.pathname.split('/').filter(Boolean)
if (pathSegments.length === 2 && pathSegments[1] === 'leads')

// After (Correct)
const pathSegments = req.url.split('/').filter(Boolean)
if (pathSegments.length === 1 && pathSegments[0] === 'leads')
```

### Database Schema Fix
```prisma
// Before (Conflict)
model Project {
  client String
  client Client @relation(...)  // ERROR: Duplicate field name
}

// After (Fixed)
model Project {
  clientName String              // String field
  client     Client? @relation(...) // Relation field
}
```
