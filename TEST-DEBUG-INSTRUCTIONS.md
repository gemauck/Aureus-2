# Debug Test Instructions

## Refresh and Test Again

I've added detailed logging to track the data flow. Please:

1. **Refresh your browser** (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Open the browser console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. **Try to create a project** with a name
4. **Copy ALL the console output** starting from when you click "Create Project"

The logs will now show:
- 💾 Form data being submitted
- 💾 Data received by handleSaveProject  
- 📤 Data being sent to API
- 🌐 API request details
- db: API response

## What to Look For

The console will now show detailed values like:
```
💾 Saving project data:
  - name: "Test Project"
  - client: "Gareth"
  - type: "Monthly Review"
  - hasName: true
  - nameLength: 12
  - full formData: {...}
```

This will help us see exactly where the name field is being lost.
