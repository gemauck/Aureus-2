## Architecture

### System Flow
```
┌─────────────────┐
│     Leads       │  (Prospect companies - not yet clients)

└─────────────────┘
        ↓ Convert when won
┌─────────────────┐
│    Clients      │  (Existing customers)
│   ├─ Sites      │  (Physical locations/installations)
│   └─ Opps       │  (Upsell/expansion opportunities)
└─────────────────┘
        ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│   Dashboard     │  Shows: Leads + Client Opportunities
│Combined Pipeline│  = Total Business Potential
└─────────────────┘

## Data Structure

### Opportunity Object
```javascript

  id: number,                    // Unique identifier
  name: string,                  // Opportunity name
  value: number,                 // Deal value in ZAR
  probability: number,           // 0-100 percentage
  stage: string,                 // Sales stage
  expectedCloseDate: string,     // ISO date format
  relatedSiteId: number|null,    // Optional site link
  notes: string,                 // Additional details
  createdAt: string              // Timestamp
}
```

### Client Object (Enhanced)
```javascript
{
  // ... existing client fields ...
  opportunities: [Opportunity]   // Array of opportunity objects
}
```

- Mixed prospects and client opportunities in Lead list
- Incomplete pipeline visibility

### After Implementation
- Complete pipeline view: Leads + Client Opportunities
- Clear separation of new business vs. expansion
- Better forecasting with weighted values
- Site-specific opportunity tracking
- Professional CRM-level functionality

## Professional CRM Comparison

This implementation follows industry-standard CRM patterns used by:
- Salesforce (Leads + Opportunities model)
- HubSpot (Deals for clients)
- Pipedrive (Pipeline for existing clients)
- Microsoft Dynamics (Opportunity management)

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mining Company Expansion
```
Client: Coastal Mining Corp (existing)
Current: 50 GPS units at Main Mine
Opportunity: "North Mine Expansion - 75 units"
Value: R 1,125,000
Probability: 70% (in negotiation)
Stage: Negotiation
Site: North Mine (new site)
```

### Scenario 2: Forestry Fleet Upgrade
```
Client: Green Forestry Services (existing)
Current: Basic telemetry on 30 vehicles
Opportunity: "Premium Telemetry Upgrade - Full Fleet"
Value: R 450,000
Probability: 50% (proposal submitted)
Stage: Proposal
Site: (company-wide, not site-specific)
```

### Scenario 3: Agricultural Client Cross-Sell
```
Client: ABC Farms Ltd (existing)
Current: Fuel monitoring only
Opportunity: "GPS Tracking Addition - 40 tractors"
Value: R 600,000
Probability: 80% (contract review)
Stage: Negotiation
Site: (multiple farms)
```

## Calculations

### Pipeline Totals
```
Combined Pipeline Value = 
  Σ(Lead Values) + Σ(Client Opportunity Values)

Example:
  Leads: R 2,750,000 (from 12 leads)
  Opportunities: R 1,250,000 (from 8 opportunities)
  Total: R 4,000,000
```

### Weighted Pipeline
```
Weighted Pipeline = 
  Σ(Lead Value × Lead Probability ÷ 100) +
  Σ(Opportunity Value × Opportunity Probability ÷ 100)

Example:
  Lead weighted: R 1,500,000
  Opportunity weighted: R 750,000
  Total weighted: R 2,250,000
```
