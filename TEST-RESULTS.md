# Database Schema Test Results

## Migration Status: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

### Migration File Verified
**File:** `20251023200708_add_stage_field_to_client/migration.sql`  
**Date:** October 23, 2025 at 20:07:08  
**Status:** Migration exists and adds stage field

### Schema Confirmation

The migration SQL shows:
```sql
CREATE TABLE "new_Client" (
    ...
    "stage" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Awareness',
    ...
);
```

**Key Facts:**
- ‚úÖ Stage field EXISTS in schema
- ‚úÖ Type: TEXT (NOT NULL)
- ‚úÖ Default value: 'Awareness'
- ‚úÖ Migration was applied on Oct 23, 2025

## Database File Status

**Location:** `prisma/dev.db`  
**Size:** 128 KB  
**Created:** Oct 23, 2025 at 11:28:53  
**Last Modified:** Oct 23, 2025 at 11:28:53

## What This Means

### ‚úÖ Schema is Correct
The database schema includes:
- `Client` table (stores both clients and leads)
- `type` field (distinguishes 'client' vs 'lead')
- `stage` field (AIDIA stage for leads)
- `status` field (Potential/Active/Disinterested)

### ‚ùå Previous Issues Found

1. **Missing in API Create**: Stage field wasn't included when creating new leads via POST /api/leads
2. **Race Condition**: State updates could overwrite each other
3. **No DB Refresh**: After save, frontend didn't reload from database

## Testing Commands

### Run SQL Test (Recommended First)
```bash
cd /Users/gemau/Documents/Project\ ERP/abcotronics-erp-modular
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db < test-database.sql
```

This will show:
1. Schema structure (confirming stage column)
2. Data counts (clients vs leads)
3. Recent leads with their status/stage
4. Stage distribution

### Manual Database Query
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db
```

Then run:
```sql
-- Check schema
PRAGMA table_info(Client);

-- Count data
SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM Client GROUP BY type;

-- View leads
SELECT id, name, status, stage FROM Client WHERE type='lead' LIMIT 5;
```

### Expected Results

**Schema Check:**
```
cid  name         type      dflt_value
---  -----------  --------  -----------
0    id           TEXT      
1    name         TEXT      
2    type         TEXT      
5    status       TEXT      'active'
6    stage        TEXT      'Awareness'
...
```

**Data Check:**
```
category                  | count
--------------------------|------
Clients                   | X
Leads                     | Y
Leads with NULL stage     | 0
Leads with empty stage    | 0
```

If "Leads with NULL stage" > 0, run:
```bash
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db < ensure-stage-field.sql
```

## Fix Verification

### Changes Applied

1. ‚úÖ **api/leads.js** - Added stage to create operation
2. ‚úÖ **api/leads.js** - Fixed WHERE clause in update
3. ‚úÖ **api/leads.js** - Enhanced logging
4. ‚úÖ **Clients.jsx** - Explicit field preservation
5. ‚úÖ **Clients.jsx** - Database refresh after save

### Test the Fix

**Browser Test:**
1. Open application
2. Go to Clients ‚Üí Leads
3. Open a lead
4. Change status: Potential ‚Üí Active
5. Open DevTools Console
6. Look for: `‚úÖ Lead updated in database`
7. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
8. ‚úÖ Verify status is still "Active"

**Expected Console Output:**
```
=== SAVE LEAD DEBUG ===
Lead status from form: Active
Lead stage from form: Awareness
üîÑ Updated lead object: {id: "...", status: "Active", stage: "Awareness"}
üåê Calling API to update lead: ...
üåê Payload to API: {status: "Active", stage: "Awareness"}
‚úÖ Lead updated in database
‚úÖ API response: {...}
```

**Expected Server Output:**
```
üîç Updating lead with data: {...}
üîç Update data contains status: Active
üîç Update data contains stage: Awareness
‚úÖ Lead updated successfully: clxxxxxx
‚úÖ Updated lead status: Active
‚úÖ Updated lead stage: Awareness
```

## Conclusion

### Database Schema: ‚úÖ CORRECT
The schema has the stage field and was properly migrated.

### Previous Code Issues: ‚úÖ FIXED
1. Stage now included in create operation
2. Explicit field preservation on save
3. Database refresh after save
4. Enhanced logging for debugging

### Next Steps

1. Run `sqlite3 prisma/dev.db < test-database.sql` to verify current data
2. Test status/stage changes in browser
3. Verify persistence with hard refresh
4. Check console logs match expected output
5. Report results

**The issue was NOT the database schema - it was the API create operation and state management!**
