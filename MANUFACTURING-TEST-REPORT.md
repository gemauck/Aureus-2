# Manufacturing Section Test Suite

## Overview

This comprehensive test suite validates both functionality and persistence of the Manufacturing section of the ERP system. The tests cover all major features including inventory management, BOM handling, production orders, stock movements, and stock locations.

## Test Files

1. **test-manufacturing-functionality.js** - Main test suite with all test cases
2. **test-manufacturing.html** - Browser-based test runner with visual interface

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Browser-Based Test Runner (Recommended)

1. Open `test-manufacturing.html` in your web browser
2. Click the "Run All Tests" button
3. View results in the console output area and summary statistics

### Option 2: Browser Console

1. Open your browser's developer console (F12)
2. Navigate to the ERP application
3. Load the test file: 
   ```javascript
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = './test-manufacturing-functionality.js';
   document.body.appendChild(script);
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```javascript
   runAllTests();
   ```

- ✅ Update stock locations
- ✅ Delete stock locations (with validation)

#### Location Type Tests
- ✅ Warehouse locations
- ✅ Vehicle locations (with registration and driver)
- ✅ Site locations
- ✅ Transit locations

#### Location Inventory Management
- ✅ Location inventory allocation
- ✅ Location statistics calculation:
  - Total items count
  - Total inventory value
  - Low stock items count
  - Unique items count

### 6. Integration Tests

#### End-to-End Workflow
1. ✅ Create inventory items
2. ✅ Create BOM using inventory items
3. ✅ Create production order from BOM
4. ✅ Record stock consumption for production
5. ✅ Complete production order
6. ✅ Verify all data persisted correctly

#### Data Integrity Tests
- ✅ Unique ID validation
- ✅ Unique SKU validation
- ✅ Calculated value consistency
- ✅ Cross-reference integrity

## Test Results Format

The test suite provides:
- **Passed Tests**: Count and details of successful tests
- **Failed Tests**: Count and error messages for failed tests
- **Warnings**: Non-critical issues or skipped tests
- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests that passed
- **Duration**: Total time taken to run all tests

## Expected Results

When all tests pass, you should see:
- ✅ All persistence tests passing
- ✅ All calculation tests passing
- ✅ All validation tests passing
- ✅ All workflow tests passing
- ✅ 100% pass rate (with possible warnings for optional features)

## localStorage Keys Tested

The test suite validates the following localStorage keys:

1. `manufacturing_inventory` - Inventory items
2. `manufacturing_boms` - Bill of Materials
3. `production_orders` - Production orders
4. `stock_movements` - Stock movement records
5. `stock_locations` - Stock location definitions
6. `location_inventory` - Inventory allocated to locations
7. `stock_transfers` - Stock transfer records

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests fail with "localStorage is undefined"
**Solution**: Ensure tests run in a browser environment, not Node.js

### Issue: Tests show duplicate data
**Solution**: Click "Clear All Data" button to reset localStorage before running tests

### Issue: Some calculations fail
**Solution**: Check that test data matches expected formats (numbers, dates, etc.)

### Issue: Cannot delete location
**Solution**: Locations can only be deleted if they have no allocated inventory

## Best Practices

1. **Run tests before deployment**: Ensure all manufacturing features work correctly
2. **Clear data between test runs**: Use "Clear All Data" to avoid test interference
3. **Review failed tests**: Check error messages to identify issues
4. **Monitor warnings**: Address warnings to improve data quality

## Future Test Enhancements

Potential additions to the test suite:
- [ ] API endpoint integration tests (when backend is implemented)
- [ ] Database persistence tests (when migrated from localStorage)
- [ ] User permission/role tests
- [ ] Concurrent access tests
- [ ] Performance/stress tests
- [ ] Data migration tests

## Notes

- All tests use localStorage (no database required)
- Tests are independent and can run in any order
- Tests clean up their own data after execution
- Tests do not require authentication (browser localStorage only)

## Support

For issues or questions about the test suite:
1. Check the console output for detailed error messages
2. Review the test code comments for implementation details
3. Verify localStorage is available and not corrupted
