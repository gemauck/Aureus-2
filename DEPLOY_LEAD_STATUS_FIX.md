# ðŸš€ Quick Deploy Guide - Lead Status Fix

## One-Command Deploy

```bash
cd /Users/gemau/Documents/Project\ ERP/abcotronics-erp-modular
chmod +x deploy-lead-status-fix.sh
./deploy-lead-status-fix.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
1. âœ… Stage your changes
2. âœ… Commit with descriptive message
3. âœ… Push to GitHub
4. âœ… Railway auto-deploys

## Manual Deploy (if script doesn't work)

```bash
cd /Users/gemau/Documents/Project\ ERP/abcotronics-erp-modular

# 1. Stage changes
git add src/components/clients/LeadDetailModal.jsx

# 2. Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Lead Status auto-save on change"

# 3. Push (triggers Railway deploy)
git push origin main
```

## Monitor Deployment

**Railway Dashboard:**
https://railway.app/dashboard

**GitHub Actions:**
https://github.com/gemauck/Abco-ERP-2/actions

## After Deployment (2-5 min)

Test the fix:
1. Open your Railway URL
2. Go to CRM & Sales â†’ Leads
3. Open any lead
4. Change Status dropdown
5. Close modal
6. Reopen same lead
7. âœ… Status should be what you changed it to!

## Your Railway URL

Find it at: https://railway.app/dashboard
(Look for your project â†’ Deployments â†’ Domain)

## Troubleshooting

### Deploy not triggering?
```bash
# Check Railway connection
git remote -v
# Should show: origin https://github.com/gemauck/Abco-ERP-2.git

# Force trigger
echo "$(date +%s)" > deploy-trigger.txt
git add deploy-trigger.txt
git commit -m "Trigger deploy"
git push origin main
```

### Check deployment logs
```bash
# Railway CLI (if installed)
railway logs

# Or check Railway dashboard â†’ your project â†’ Deployments â†’ View logs
```

## Rollback (if needed)
