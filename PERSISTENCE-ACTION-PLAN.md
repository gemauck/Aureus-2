# Persistence Testing - Quick Action Plan

## ✅ Completed
1. Server restarted successfully on port 3000
2. Architecture reviewed and documented
3. Health endpoint verified
4. Comprehensive test report created

## 🎯 How to Test Persistence

### Option 1: Use Browser DevTools
1. Open the application in browser
2. Login to get authentication token
3. Navigate to Projects section
4. Open DevTools Console
5. Create/Edit/Delete a project
6. Watch console logs for persistence flow

### Option 2: Use Test HTML File
1. Open `test-project-creation.html` in browser
2. Ensure you're logged in (token in localStorage)
3. Click "Create Test Project" button
4. Verify project appears in list
5. Refresh page and verify persistence

### Option 3: Use cURL Commands
```bash
# Get token first (from browser localStorage)
TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Create project
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Project","clientName":"Test Client"}'

# List projects
curl http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## 🔍 Key Things to Watch For

### In Console Logs:
- ✅ `📡 Creating project in database...`
- ✅ `✅ Project created in database`
- ✅ `📡 Fetching projects from database...`
- ✅ `Database returned projects: X`

### In Network Tab:
- POST `/api/projects` - Status 201 (Created)
- GET `/api/projects` - Status 200 (OK)
- Check request/response payloads

### Common Issues to Watch:
- ❌ Missing authentication token
- ❌ Empty project name (validation error)
- ❌ Network failures (should retry)
- ❌ Data not persisting after refresh

## 📊 Persistence Flow Verification

```
User Action: Create Project
    ↓
Frontend: handleSaveProject()
    ↓
API: DatabaseAPI.createProject()
    ↓
Server: POST /api/projects
    ↓
Prisma: CREATE project
    ↓
Database: SQLite INSERT
    ↓
Response: Return new project
    ↓
Frontend: Update state
    ↓
Verify: Page refresh → Data still there ✅
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Project not saving
**Check:**
1. Authentication token valid?
2. Project name not empty?
3. Network connection active?
4. Server logs for errors

### Problem: Data disappears after refresh
**Check:**
1. Database actually saved the data?
2. GET request returning correct data?
3. Frontend parsing response correctly?

### Problem: Multiple projects with same data
**Check:**
1. Not calling save multiple times?
2. Optimistic updates working correctly?
3. Server idempotency handling?

## 📝 Test Checklist
