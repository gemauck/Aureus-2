   - The column will highlight with a blue ring and light blue background
   - Release to drop the card

4. **Auto-Save**
   - Changes save immediately to localStorage
   - No confirmation needed
   - Pipeline refreshes automatically

## 🎨 Visual Feedback

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Implementation:
- **HTML5 Drag & Drop API** (native, no libraries needed)
- **State Management**: React useState for drag tracking
- **Persistence**: localStorage auto-save on drop
- **Type Safety**: Distinguishes between leads and opportunities
- **Data Integrity**: Updates correct records in correct locations

### Events Used:
- `onDragStart` - Tracks what's being dragged
- `onDragOver` - Allows dropping (preventDefault)
- `onDrop` - Updates data and saves
- `onDragEnd` - Cleans up drag state

### CSS Classes:
- `cursor-move` - Indicates draggable items
- `opacity-50` - Shows item being dragged
- `ring-2 ring-primary-400` - Highlights valid drop zone
- `bg-primary-50` - Background color change on hover

## 📱 Compatibility

### Desktop:
✅ **Perfect** - Full mouse drag and drop support

### Tablet:
✅ **Works** - Touch drag and drop supported

### Mobile:
⚠️ **Partial** - Small columns make dragging difficult
- Recommend landscape mode
- May need touch-hold to initiate drag

## 🎓 Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Drag cards to update stages as deals progress
- ✅ Use visual feedback to confirm drops
- ✅ Organize pipeline regularly
- ✅ Move multiple items in sequence

### DON'T:
- ❌ Drop in same column (nothing happens)
- ❌ Drag while modal is open (close first)
- ❌ Expect undo (changes are immediate)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Card won't drag
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're clicking on the card itself, not a button
- Try clicking and holding for a moment before dragging
- Refresh page if cards seem "stuck"

### Issue: Drop doesn't work
**Solution:**
- Make sure the column highlights (blue ring) when you hover
- Drop fully inside the column area
- Check that you're not dropping in the same stage

### Issue: Card disappears
**Solution:**
- This shouldn't happen! If it does:
- Check the diagnostic tool (`debug-opportunities.html`)
- Verify data is in localStorage
- Refresh the page
- Report as a bug

### Issue: Changes don't save
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify localStorage is enabled
- Try the diagnostic tool to check data
- Ensure you're not in incognito mode

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
