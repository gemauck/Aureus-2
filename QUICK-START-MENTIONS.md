The system matches usernames by:
- Full name (e.g., "John Doe")
- First name (e.g., "John")
- Email username (e.g., "john" from john@company.com)

### 🚫 Self-Mentions
You won't be notified if you mention yourself.

### 🔔 Real-Time Updates
Notifications refresh automatically every 30 seconds.

### 💬 Multiple Mentions
You can mention multiple people in one comment:
```
@john please review this, and @sarah can you test it?
```

### 📝 Mentioning in Context
Always provide context:
```
@john Please review this budget proposal for Q4
```
