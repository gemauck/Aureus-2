## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. Navigate to Teams section in the ERP
2. Click on any department team
3. Click "Create Workflow"
4. Add steps with schematics:
   - Upload diagrams for visual guidance
   - Add checkpoints for quality control
   - Set assignees and durations
5. Save and execute the workflow

### Example: Technical Installation Process
```
Workflow: "Fuel Telemetry Device Installation"

Step 1: Tank Preparation
├── Schematic: tank_diagram.png
├── Checkpoints: 
│   ├── Tank cleaned and dry
│   ├── Mounting points identified
│   └── Safety equipment ready
└── Duration: 30 minutes

Step 2: Sensor Installation  
├── Schematic: sensor_wiring.png
├── Checkpoints:
│   ├── Sensors mounted securely
│   ├── Wiring connected per diagram
│   └── Connections tested
└── Duration: 45 minutes

Step 3: Module Configuration
├── Schematic: gsm_module_setup.png
├── Checkpoints:
│   ├── Module powered on
│   ├── SIM card active
│   └── Network connection verified
└── Duration: 20 minutes
```
