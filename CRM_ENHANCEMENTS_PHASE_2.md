    // Auto-save if needed
    onSave({...formData, contracts: updatedContracts});
};

// In the "Contracts" tab content
{activeTab === 'contracts' && (
    <ContractsManager
        clientId={client?.id}
        clientName={client?.name}
        contracts={contracts}
        onSave={handleSaveContracts}
    />
)}
```

### Step 3: Add Health Score Tab to ClientDetailModal
