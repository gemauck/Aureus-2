# Projects Board View - New Structure

## Overview

The Projects section now displays as a **horizontal board view** with Lists as columns and Tasks/Subtasks as cards.

## Structure

```
Project
  └── Lists (Horizontal Columns)
       └── Tasks (Cards with full details)
            └── Subtasks (Indented cards with full details)
```

## Layout

### **Horizontal List Columns**
- Lists are displayed as vertical columns across the page
- Each column scrolls independently
- Columns are 380px wide
- Scroll horizontally to see all lists

### **Task Cards**
Each task card displays:
- ✅ Title
- 📝 Description
- 👤 Assignee
- 📅 Due Date
- 🎯 Priority badge (High/Medium/Low)
- 🔖 Custom fields
- 📊 Subtask count
- ⚙️ Actions (Add Subtask, Edit, Delete)

### **Subtask Cards**
Subtasks have **ALL the same fields as main tasks**:
- ✅ Title
- 📝 Description  
- 👤 Assignee
- 📅 Due Date
- 🎯 Priority badge
- 🔖 Custom fields
- ⚙️ Actions (Edit, Delete)

**Visual Differences:**
- Indented 16px to the left
- Has a blue left border
- Shows arrow icon (↪) indicating it's a child
- Displayed directly below parent task

## Features

### **List Management**
- **Add List**: Button in header
- **Edit List**: Pencil icon on list header
- **Delete List**: Trash icon (cannot delete "Main Tasks")
- Each list shows task count

### **Task Management**
- **Add Task**: "Add Task" button at top of each list
- **Edit Task**: Pencil icon on task card
- **Delete Task**: Trash icon (deletes all subtasks too)
- **List Assignment**: Tasks stay in their list (cannot be moved after creation)

### **Subtask Management**
- **Add Subtask**: "Add Subtask" button on parent task card
- **Edit Subtask**: Edit icon on subtask card
- **Delete Subtask**: Trash icon on subtask card
- Subtasks inherit the same list as their parent
- Subtasks have ALL the same fields as tasks

## Key Changes from Previous Version

### ✅ What Changed:

1. **Visual Layout**: Changed from drill-down navigation to horizontal board view
2. **Subtask Display**: Subtasks now show full details (assignee, due date, priority, custom fields)
3. **Navigation**: No more clicking through Lists → Tasks → Subtasks
4. **List Lock**: Cannot change list after task creation (prevents confusion)
5. **Simplified Workflow**: Everything visible at once

### 🗑️ What Was Removed:

1. Kanban/List/Calendar view switcher
2. Drill-down navigation with breadcrumbs
3. Separate subtask management modal
4. "Manage Subtasks" button
5. Nested subtask hierarchy (subtasks cannot have sub-subtasks)

## Workflow Examples

### Creating a Task:
1. Click "Add Task" in desired list column
2. Fill in: Title, Description, Assignee, Due Date, Priority
3. Add custom fields if needed
4. Click "Create"
5. Task appears in the list column

### Adding a Subtask:
1. Find parent task in its list
2. Click "Add Subtask" button on task card
3. Fill in ALL fields (same as main task)
4. Click "Create"
5. Subtask appears indented below parent

### Editing:
1. Click Edit icon on task or subtask
2. Modify any fields
3. **Note**: Cannot change which list it's in
4. Click "Update"

## Design Philosophy

**Everything at a glance** - See all lists, tasks, and subtasks simultaneously without clicking through multiple views. This mirrors tools like:
- Trello boards
- Asana board view
- Monday.com boards
- ClickUp board view

## Benefits

✅ **Faster Overview**: See entire project structure at once
✅ **Less Clicking**: No drill-down navigation needed  
✅ **Consistent Data**: Subtasks have same fields as tasks
✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear parent-child relationships
✅ **Easy Reorganization**: Manage lists horizontally
✅ **Quick Actions**: All actions visible on cards

## Tips

- **Scroll Horizontally**: Use mouse wheel or trackpad to see all lists
- **Color Coding**: Lists have color indicators for quick identification
- **Subtask Organization**: Keep subtasks focused - they're visible inline
- **List Strategy**: Use lists for work phases or categories
- **Priority Colors**: Red (High), Yellow (Medium), Green (Low)
