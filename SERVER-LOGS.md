## Real-Time Monitoring

### Interview Server Logs
The server is currently outputting logs to the terminal/console where it was started. To view live logs:

1. **If server is running in terminal:**
   - Scroll to view recent activity
   - Watch for new requests as they come in

2. **If you want to view in a new terminal:**
   ```bash
   # Find the process
   ps aux | grep "node server.js"
   
   # View output (if still attached)
   # Or restart with output redirected
   node server.js > server-output.log 2>&1
   ```

## Key Observations from Logs

### ‚úÖ Working Correctly
- Authentication and authorization
- CORS handling
- Database connections
- All CRUD operations
- Logging and debugging output
- Request routing

### üîç Path Parsing
The logs show detailed path parsing:
```
üîç Projects API: Path segments: [ 'api', 'projects', 'cmh8k7n5k0001koyf05kb9v10' ]
üîç Projects API: Extracted ID: cmh8k7n5k0001koyf05kb9v10
```
This confirms the routing system is working correctly.

## Performance Metrics

### Response Times (from logs)
- Projects GET: ~2-11ms
- Clients GET: ~2-9ms
- Leads GET: ~10ms
- Invoices GET: ~7-12ms
- Time entries GET: ~7-10ms
- Users GET: ~7ms
- Projects PUT: ~1ms

**All operations are very fast!** ‚ö°

## Recommendations

### For Better Log Monitoring
1. Consider using a log aggregation tool (e.g., Winston, Pino-Pretty)
2. Implement log rotation
3. Add request/response logging middleware
4. Create separate log files for different environments

### Current Setup is Working Well
‚úÖ Server is stable
‚úÖ All operations completing successfully
‚úÖ No critical errors in recent logs
‚úÖ Fast response times

---

**Last Updated:** Based on terminal logs from recent activity
**Server Status:** ‚úÖ Running and Healthy
**Database:** ‚úÖ Connected
**Authentication:** ‚úÖ Working
**Persistence:** ‚úÖ Verified

**Next Steps:**
1. Check if `MonthlyDocumentCollectionTracker` component exists
2. Rebuild the frontend if needed
3. Use localhost for development instead of production URL
