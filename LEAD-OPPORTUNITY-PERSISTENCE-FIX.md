# Lead & Opportunity Kanban Persistence Fix

## Issue Found ❌

**Problem:** When dragging leads or opportunities between AIDIA funnel stages, they would move visually but NOT persist to the database. After page refresh, they would return to their original stage.

**Root Cause:** In `src/components/clients/Clients.jsx` line 1008, the `handleDrop` function for leads only updated local state but never called the API to save the stage change.

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
if (draggedType === 'lead') {
    const updatedLeads = leads.map(lead => 
        lead.id === draggedItem.id ? { ...lead, stage: targetStage } : lead
    );
    setLeads(updatedLeads);
    // ❌ NO API CALL! Only local state update!
}
```

## Fixes Applied ✅

### Fix 1: Missing API Persistence for Kanban Drag-and-Drop

**Location:** `src/components/clients/Clients.jsx` lines 1003-1036

**For Leads:**
```javascript
if (draggedType === 'lead') {
    const updatedLeads = leads.map(lead => 
        lead.id === draggedItem.id ? { ...lead, stage: targetStage } : lead
    );
    setLeads(updatedLeads);
    
    // ✅ Now calls API to persist!
    const token = window.storage?.getToken?.();
    if (token && window.DatabaseAPI) {
        window.DatabaseAPI.updateLead(draggedItem.id, { stage: targetStage })
            .then(() => console.log('✅ Lead stage updated:', targetStage))
            .catch(err => console.error('❌ Failed to update lead stage:', err));
    }
}
```

**For Opportunities:**
```javascript
else if (draggedType === 'opportunity') {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // ✅ Also added API persistence!
    const token = window.storage?.getToken?.();
    if (token && window.DatabaseAPI && draggedItem.id) {
        window.DatabaseAPI.updateOpportunity(draggedItem.id, { stage: targetStage })
            .then(() => console.log('✅ Opportunity stage updated:', targetStage))
            .catch(err => console.error('❌ Failed to update opportunity stage:', err));
    }
}
```

## Database Verification

**Current Data:**
- **Leads:** 2 leads
  - Lead 1: "Gareth" - Stage: "Awareness"
  - Lead 2: "Test Lead" - Stage: "Interest"
- **Opportunities:** 1 opportunity
  - Opportunity 1: "asdf" - Stage: "Awareness"

## Testing

### How to Test:
1. Open the application
2. Navigate to Clients/Pipeline view
3. Drag a lead from one AIDIA stage to another
4. Refresh the page
5. **Expected:** Lead should stay in the new stage ✅

### Console Logs to Watch:
```
✅ Lead stage updated: [stage name]
```

### Fix 2: Missing Stage Field in Client Mapping

**Location:** `src/components/clients/Clients.jsx` line 203

**Problem:** When `loadClients()` was called, it was processing leads from the API response but NOT mapping the `stage` field. This caused leads loaded through this function to lose their stage.

**Solution:** Added `stage: c.stage || 'Awareness'` to the `processedClients` mapping.

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const processedClients = apiClients.map(c => ({
    id: c.id,
    name: c.name,
    status: c.status === 'active' ? 'Active' : 'Inactive',
    // ❌ Missing stage field!
    industry: c.industry || 'Other',
    // ...
}));

// AFTER (FIXED):
const processedClients = apiClients.map(c => ({
    id: c.id,
    name: c.name,
    status: c.status === 'active' ? 'Active' : 'Inactive',
    stage: c.stage || 'Awareness', // ✅ Now includes stage!
    industry: c.industry || 'Other',
    // ...
}));
```

## Additional Fixes

### Earlier Fix - Projects Update Handler
Also fixed missing fields in project update handler:
- Added: documents, comments, activityLog, hasDocumentCollectionProcess, documentSections

## Server Status

✅ Server restarted with fixes applied
✅ Ready for testing
