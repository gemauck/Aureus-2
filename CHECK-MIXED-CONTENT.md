# Check for Mixed Content Issue

You've cleared the cache but still see "Not Secure". This likely means there's **mixed content** - some resources loading over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

## Please Do This Now

### Step 1: Open Browser DevTools
1. Visit `https://abcoafrica.co.za`
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the **Console** tab

### Step 2: Look for Mixed Content Errors
In the Console, do you see any errors like:
- "Mixed Content"
- "was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource"
- "blocked:mixed-content"

**If you see these errors, note which resources they mention.**

### Step 3: Check Network Tab
1. Go to **Network** tab in DevTools
2. Reload the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. Look for ANY resources that show:
   - **Red X** icon
   - **Orange triangle** warning
   - URL starting with `http://` (not `https://`)

4. Click on any such resources
5. Tell me what they are

### Step 4: Check for Failed Resources
In the Network tab, filter by **Failed** (red):
- Click the filter icon
- Select "Failed"
- Are there any failed resources?

### Step 5: Screenshot the Console
1. Screenshot the **Console** tab (any red errors)
2. Screenshot the **Network** tab showing any warnings/errors
3. Share these screenshots

## Common Mixed Content Sources

Check if any of these are loading over HTTP:
- ❌ Font Awesome: `http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/...`
- ❌ Leaflet CSS: `http://unpkg.com/leaflet...`
- ❌ React libraries: `http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/...`
- ❌ Favicon: `http://abcoafrica.co.za/favicon.svg`
- ❌ CSS files: `http://abcoafrica.co.za/dist/styles.css`

## Quick Check - Copy This into Browser Console

While on `https://abcoafrica.co.za`, open Console (F12) and paste this:

```javascript
// Find all resources that were loaded over HTTP
const resources = performance.getEntriesByType('resource');
const httpResources = resources.filter(r => r.name.startsWith('http://'));
console.log('HTTP Resources:', httpResources.map(r => r.name));

// Check if page is actually HTTPS
console.log('Current Protocol:', window.location.protocol);

// Check for mixed content warnings
console.log('Page is:', window.location.href);
```

Copy the output and share it with me.

## Alternative: Check Certificate Directly

1. Click the **lock/info icon** in address bar
2. Click **"Certificate (Valid)"** or **"View certificates"**
3. Take a screenshot of the certificate details
4. Share it with me

This will help me see what the browser is actually showing.

## What I Need

Please provide:
1. Screenshot of Console tab showing errors
2. Screenshot of Network tab showing any HTTP resources or failures
3. Which browser you're using (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. Browser version

This will help me identify the exact problem.
