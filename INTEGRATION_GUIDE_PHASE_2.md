## 📅 Date: October 15, 2025

---

## 🎯 What You're Adding

This guide shows you how to integrate:
1. **Enhanced Contracts Tab** - Full contract lifecycle management
2. **Health Score Tab** - AI-style client health monitoring

---

## 📂 Files You Need

1. `CONTRACTS_TAB_ENHANCEMENT.js` - Contract management code
2. `HEALTH_TAB_ENHANCEMENT.js` - Health scoring code
3. This guide - `INTEGRATION_GUIDE_PHASE_2.md`

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Integration

### Step 1: Update the Tabs Array

**Location**: `ClientDetailModal.jsx` - Line ~152 (in the tabs rendering section)

**Find this line**:
```javascript
{['overview', 'contacts', 'sites', 'opportunities', 'calendar', 'projects', 'contracts', 'activity', 'notes'].map(tab => (
```

**Change to**:
```javascript
{['overview', 'contacts', 'sites', 'opportunities', 'calendar', 'projects', 'contracts', 'health', 'activity', 'notes'].map(tab => (
```

**What changed**: Added `'health'` between `'contracts'` and `'activity'`

---

### Step 2: Add Tab Icon for Health

**Location**: Same section, in the `fa-${...}` icon mapping

**Find**:
```javascript
tab === 'contracts' ? 'file-contract' :
tab === 'activity' ? 'history' :
```

**Change to**:
```javascript
tab === 'contracts' ? 'file-contract' :
tab === 'health' ? 'heartbeat' :
tab === 'activity' ? 'history' :
```

---

### Step 3: Add Contract State Variables

**Location**: Near the top of ClientDetailModal, after existing useState declarations

**Add these state variables** (around line 20-30):
```javascript
const [showContractForm, setShowContractForm] = useState(false);
const [editingContract, setEditingContract] = useState(null);
const [newContract, setNewContract] = useState({
    title: '',
    type: 'Service Agreement',
    value: 0,
    startDate: '',
    endDate: '',
    status: 'Active',
    signedDate: '',
    renewalDate: '',
    autoRenew: false,
    paymentTerms: 'Net 30',
    billingFrequency: 'Monthly',
    notes: '',
    attachments: []
});
```

---

### Step 4: Add Contract Handlers

**Location**: After `handleDeleteOpportunity` function (around line 450)

**Copy and paste** all the contract handler functions from `CONTRACTS_TAB_ENHANCEMENT.js`:
- `handleAddContract`
- `handleEditContract`
- `handleUpdateContract`
- `handleDeleteContract`
- `getDaysUntilExpiry`

---

### Step 5: Add Health Score Calculator

**Location**: After the contract handlers you just added

**Copy and paste** the `calculateHealthScore` function from `HEALTH_TAB_ENHANCEMENT.js`

---

### Step 6: Replace Contracts Tab Content

**Location**: Find the `{activeTab === 'contracts' && (` section (around line 800-1000)

**Current code**: The basic contracts tab with billing terms and document upload

**Replace with**: The complete enhanced contracts tab from `CONTRACTS_TAB_ENHANCEMENT.js`

**Tip**: Search for `{activeTab === 'contracts'` to find the exact location

---

### Step 7: Add Health Tab Content

**Location**: After the contracts tab, before the activity tab

**Add**: The complete health tab code from `HEALTH_TAB_ENHANCEMENT.js`

**Insert location**: Between `{activeTab === 'contracts' && (...)}` and `{activeTab === 'activity' && (...)}

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find name 'handleAddContract'"
**Solution**: Make sure you copied all contract handlers from Step 4

### Issue: "Cannot find name 'calculateHealthScore'"
**Solution**: Make sure you copied the health score calculator from Step 5

### Issue: Contracts tab doesn't show new features
**Solution**: Make sure you replaced the entire contracts tab content in Step 6

### Issue: Health tab doesn't appear
**Solution**: 
1. Check Step 1 - Did you add 'health' to the tabs array?
2. Check Step 2 - Did you add the health icon mapping?
3. Check Step 7 - Did you add the health tab content?

### Issue: Health score always shows 0
**Solution**: Check that formData has the required fields:
- `lastContact`
- `projectIds`
- `contracts`
- `followUps`
- `comments`
- `activityLog`
- `sites`

### Issue: Contract warnings don't show
**Solution**: Make sure contracts have `endDate` and `status: 'Active'` set

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Health Score Weights

Edit the `calculateHealthScore` function:
```javascript
// Current weights:
// Communication: 30 points
// Projects: 25 points
// Contracts: 20 points
// Engagement: 15 points
// Sites: 10 points

// To change, modify the score calculations
// Example: Give more weight to contracts
contractScore = activeContracts > 0 ? 30 : 0; // Instead of 20
```

### Change Contract Types

Edit the `newContract` state or form:
```javascript
<option>Service Agreement</option>
<option>Master Service Agreement</option>
<option>Equipment Lease</option>
// Add more options here
<option>Your Custom Type</option>
```

### Change Expiry Warning Days

Find `getDaysUntilExpiry` usages:
```javascript
// Current: 90 days
const isExpiringSoon = daysUntilExpiry !== null && daysUntilExpiry > 0 && daysUntilExpiry <= 90;

// Change to 60 days:
const isExpiringSoon = daysUntilExpiry !== null && daysUntilExpiry > 0 && daysUntilExpiry <= 60;
```
