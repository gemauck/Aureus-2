# Cache Clearing Fix - Lead Status Update Issue

## Problem
Lead status changes were appearing to save successfully but would revert to the old status after a page refresh. The issue was a **caching problem** in `databaseAPI-new.js`.

## Root Cause
When updating a lead (or any other entity), the API cache was **not being cleared** after the update completed. This meant:

1. User changes lead status from "Inactive" to "Active"
2. API successfully updates the database ‚úÖ
3. Local state updates immediately ‚úÖ
4. Cache still contains old data with "Inactive" status ‚ùå
5. When force refreshing, the system returns **cached stale data** instead of fetching fresh data from the database

## Solution
Added cache clearing after **all data modification operations** (create, update, delete) across all entity types.

### Changes Made to `databaseAPI-new.js`

#### 1. Update Operations (all entities)
Added cache clearing after successful update:
```javascript
async updateLead(id, leadData) {
    const result = await this.makeRequest(`/leads/${id}`, {
        method: 'PATCH',
        body: JSON.stringify(leadData)
    });
    // Clear leads cache after update to ensure fresh data on next fetch
    this.clearCache('/leads');
    console.log('‚úÖ Lead cache cleared after update');
    return result;
}
```

Applied to:
- `updateClient()`
- `updateLead()` ‚Üê **This was the main issue**
- `updateProject()`
- `updateInvoice()`
- `updateTimeEntry()`
- `updateUser()`

#### 2. Create Operations (all entities)
Added cache clearing after successful creation:
```javascript
async createLead(leadData) {
    const result = await this.makeRequest('/leads', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(leadData)
    });
    // Clear leads cache after creation to ensure fresh data on next fetch
    this.clearCache('/leads');
    return result;
}
```

Applied to:
- `createClient()`
- `createLead()`
- `createProject()`
- `createInvoice()`
- `createTimeEntry()`
- `createUser()`

#### 3. Delete Operations (all entities)
Added cache clearing after successful deletion:
```javascript
async deleteLead(id) {
    const result = await this.makeRequest(`/leads/${id}`, {
        method: 'DELETE'
    });
    // Clear leads cache after deletion to ensure fresh data on next fetch
    this.clearCache('/leads');
    return result;
}
```

Applied to:
- `deleteClient()`
- `deleteLead()`
- `deleteProject()` (already had cache clearing)
- `deleteInvoice()`
- `deleteTimeEntry()`
- `deleteUser()`

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken)
1. Update lead status ‚Üí API call succeeds
2. Cache still has old data
3. Force refresh ‚Üí Returns stale cached data ‚ùå
4. Status reverts to old value

### After (Fixed)
1. Update lead status ‚Üí API call succeeds
2. **Cache is immediately cleared** ‚ú®
3. Force refresh ‚Üí Fetches fresh data from database ‚úÖ
4. Status persists correctly

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. Open the Clients page
2. Change a lead's status (e.g., from "Inactive" to "Active")
3. Watch the console logs - you should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Lead status updated in database
   ‚úÖ Lead cache cleared after update
   üîÑ Force refreshing leads from database...
   üì° Fetching leads from database... (FORCE REFRESH)
   ```
4. Refresh the entire page
5. The status change should persist ‚úÖ

## Additional Benefits
This fix not only resolves the lead status issue but also prevents similar caching problems across:
- Client updates
- Project updates
- Invoice updates
- Time entry updates
- User updates
- All create and delete operations

## Console Logs to Look For
Success indicators:
- `‚úÖ Lead cache cleared after update`
- `‚úÖ Client cache cleared after update`
- `‚úÖ Project cache cleared after update`
- `‚úÖ Invoice cache cleared after update`
- `‚úÖ Time entry cache cleared after update`
- `‚úÖ User cache cleared after update`
