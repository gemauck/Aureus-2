# Debugging Feedback Email Not Arriving

## ✅ What's Working
- Direct email to `gemauck@gmail.com` works ✅
- SendGrid API is configured correctly ✅
- Email sending infrastructure works ✅

## ❌ Issue
Feedback emails from the feedback widget aren't arriving, even though direct emails work.

## 🔍 Likely Causes

### 1. Admin User Configuration Issue

The feedback system sends emails to all users with:
- `role: 'admin'`
- `status: 'active'`
- Valid `email` address

**Check:**
- Is your admin user's email set to `gemauck@gmail.com`?
- Does your admin user have `role: 'admin'` (not `'ADMIN'` or other variations)?
- Is your admin user's `status: 'active'`?

### 2. Server Environment Variables

The server needs SendGrid configuration in production:
- `SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net`
- `SMTP_PASS=SG.your-key`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-key`
- `EMAIL_FROM=garethm@abcotronics.co.za`

**Check server logs** when feedback is submitted - you should see:
```
📧 Starting feedback email notification process...
📧 Found X admin(s) to notify: email@example.com
📧 Attempting to send feedback email to...
```

### 3. Email Filtering

Even if sent, emails might be:
- Filtered to spam/junk
- Blocked by email provider
- Not delivered due to sender verification

## 🔧 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Server Logs

When you submit feedback, check the server console/logs. Look for:

```
📧 Starting feedback email notification process...
📧 Found X admin(s) to notify: ...
```

If you see:
- `⚠️ No admin users found` → Your user account isn't set as admin
- `📧 Found 0 admin(s)` → No admins with email addresses
- No logs at all → Feedback endpoint not being called

### Step 2: Verify Your Admin User

1. Log into the ERP system
2. Check your user profile - verify:
   - Your email is `gemauck@gmail.com` (or your actual email)
   - Your role is `admin` (lowercase)
   - Your status is `active`

### Step 3: Update Admin Email (if needed)

If your admin user has a different email, update it:
- Go to User Management
- Edit your user
- Set email to `gemauck@gmail.com`
- Ensure role is `admin` and status is `active`

### Step 4: Test Feedback Submission

1. Submit feedback through the feedback widget
2. Watch server logs in real-time
3. Check for email notification logs
4. Check SendGrid Activity Feed: https://app.sendgrid.com/activity

### Step 5: Check SendGrid Activity

Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/activity

Look for emails sent when you submit feedback:
- ✅ **Delivered** = Email was sent
- ⚠️ **Blocked/Bounced** = Address or verification issue
- ❌ **No email** = Email wasn't sent from server

## 📊 Server Log Checklist

When submitting feedback, you should see in server logs:

```
📧 Starting feedback email notification process...
📧 Found 1 admin(s) to notify: gemauck@gmail.com
📧 Attempting to send feedback email to gemauck@gmail.com...
✅ Feedback email sent successfully to gemauck@gmail.com: sendgrid-xxxxx
📧 Feedback email notification summary:
   ✅ Successfully sent: 1
   ❌ Failed: 0
   Total admins: 1
```

## 🔍 Quick Diagnostic Commands

### Check if feedback is being saved:
```bash
# Check database for recent feedback
# (Use your database tool or API)
```

### Test feedback endpoint directly:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Test feedback",
    "pageUrl": "/test",
    "section": "Testing",
    "type": "feedback"
  }'
```

## ✅ Expected Fix

After ensuring:
1. Admin user has email `gemauck@gmail.com`
2. Admin user has `role: 'admin'` and `status: 'active'`
3. Server has SendGrid configuration
4. Server logs show emails being sent

Feedback emails should arrive at `gemauck@gmail.com`.

---

**Most likely issue:** Your admin user account email doesn't match `gemauck@gmail.com`, or the admin user doesn't exist in the database.
