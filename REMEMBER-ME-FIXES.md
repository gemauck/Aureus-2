# Remember Me Functionality - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Remember Me Checkbox Visibility
**Problem:** Checkbox was disappearing on small screens or after resizing.

**Solution:**
- Removed negative `margin-top` that was causing layout issues
- Added explicit `visibility: visible !important` and `opacity: 1 !important`
- Increased checkbox size from 18px to 20px for better visibility
- Added `min-height: 44px` for proper touch target size
- Added responsive styles for very small screens (360px and below)
- Added explicit display rules in media queries

### 2. ✅ Form Disappearing on Small Screens
**Problem:** Login form was disappearing or getting cut off on small screens.

**Solution:**
- Added `max-height: calc(100vh - 2rem)` to login card
- Made form container scrollable with `overflow-y: auto`
- Added flexbox layout to login card for better structure
- Improved padding and spacing on small screens
- Added special handling for screens with height < 600px

### 3. ✅ Incognito Mode Handling
**Problem:** "Remember me" doesn't work in incognito mode (localStorage is cleared when session ends).

**Solution:**
- Added localStorage availability check on mount
- Added helpful console message explaining incognito mode behavior
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks
- Made functionality gracefully degrade (browser password manager still works)

### 4. ✅ Better Responsive Design
**Problem:** Elements were not properly visible at all screen sizes.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive media queries for screens 360px and smaller
- Added media queries for short screens (height < 600px)
- Ensured remember me checkbox has explicit visibility rules in all breakpoints
- Improved form spacing and gaps on small screens

## Testing Instructions

### Test Remember Me Visibility:
1. Open login page at different window sizes
2. Resize browser window from large to small
3. **Verify:** Remember me checkbox is always visible
4. **Verify:** Form remains scrollable and visible

### Test on Small Screens:
1. Use browser DevTools responsive mode
2. Test at 360px width (iPhone SE size)
3. Test at short height (600px height)
4. **Verify:** All form elements visible and accessible
5. **Verify:** Form scrolls smoothly

### Test Incognito Mode:
1. Open in incognito/private mode
2. Login with "Remember me" checked
3. Check console for info message about localStorage
4. **Note:** Email will be remembered during the session but cleared when incognito window closes
5. **Verify:** Browser password manager still prompts to save (works independently)

### Test Normal Mode:
1. Open in regular browser mode
2. Login with "Remember me" checked
3. Logout
4. Return to login page
5. **Verify:** Email is pre-filled automatically

## Known Behavior

### Incognito/Private Mode:
- **Remember me will work within the session** (email saved in localStorage)
- **Email will be cleared when incognito window closes** (this is browser behavior, not a bug)
- **Browser password manager will still work** and prompt to save passwords
- This is expected behavior - incognito mode is designed to not persist data

### Small Screens:
- Form will scroll if content exceeds viewport height
- Remember me checkbox is always visible
- All form elements remain accessible

## Files Modified
