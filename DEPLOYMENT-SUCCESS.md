## Testing

### Next Steps for User Testing
1. Visit: **https://abcoafrica.co.za**
2. Try logging in with valid credentials
3. Verify authentication works correctly

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Login should work without CORS errors
- ✅ Refresh token should be stored in secure cookie
- ✅ Access token should be returned in response
- ✅ User should be redirected to dashboard after login

### Browser Console
After deployment, the previous errors should be resolved:
- ❌ `POST https://abcoafrica.co.za/api/auth/refresh 401 (Unauthorized)` - Should be resolved
- ❌ `POST https://abcoafrica.co.za/api/login 500 (Internal Server Error)` - Should be resolved
- ❌ `No refresh token` - Should be resolved

## Server Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/dev.db
JWT_SECRET=0266f788ee2255e2aa973f0984903fb61f3fb1d9f address... (configured)
```

### PM2 Process
```bash
Name: abcotronics-erp
Status: online
PID: 19495
Restarts: 3
```

## Notes

### Database Issues
The server is currently experiencing some Prisma connection errors in the logs, but the server is running and handling requests. These errors are from previous startup attempts. If authentication still fails, you may need to check the database connection.

### Cookie Behavior
- **Production (https://abcoafrica.co.za):** Secure flag is set ✅
- **Development (localhost):** Secure flag is NOT set ✅

This means:
- Cookies work in production over HTTPS
- Cookies work in development over HTTP
- Both scenarios are properly handled

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for new errors
2. Check server logs: `ssh root@165.22.127.196 "pm2 logs abcotronics-erp"`
3. Verify environment variables are correct
4. Test with a fresh browser session (clear cookies)

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR TESTING
