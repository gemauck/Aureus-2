# API Routing Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing API failures where multiple endpoints (`/api/projects`, `/api/leads`, `/api/invoices`, `/api/time-entries`) were returning HTML responses instead of JSON. This was causing console errors like:

```
Non-JSON response from /api/projects: <!DOCTYPE html>...
Database API request failed (/api/projects): Error: Server returned non-JSON response. Status: 200
```

## Root Cause
The production server (`server-production.js`) only had hardcoded API endpoints for a few routes (health, auth/login, clients, users) but was missing the dynamic routing logic to load other API handlers. All unhandled API requests were falling through to the catch-all route that serves `index.html`, resulting in HTML being returned instead of JSON.

## Solution
Updated `server-production.js` to include dynamic API routing middleware that:

1. **Dynamically loads API handlers** from the `/api` directory
2. **Matches routes** using the same logic as `server.js`:
   - Direct file matches (e.g., `/api/leads` → `api/leads.js`)
   - Nested directory matches
   - Dynamic route matches (e.g., `/api/clients/123` → `api/clients/[id].js`)
3. **Returns proper JSON error responses** when endpoints are not found
4. **Sets correct CORS headers** for all API responses

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Dynamic API Handler Loading (`server-production.js`)
```javascript
function toHandlerPath(urlPath) {
  const parts = urlPath.replace(/^\/api\/?/, '').split('/').filter(Boolean)
  // ... logic to find the correct handler file
}

async function loadHandler(handlerPath) {
  // ... logic to import and return the handler
}
```

### 2. Replaced Hardcoded Endpoints with Dynamic Routing
```javascript
app.use('/api', async (req, res) => {
  const handlerPath = toHandlerPath(req.url)
  const handler = await loadHandler(handlerPath)
  
  if (!handler) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'API endpoint not found' })
  }
  
  await handler(req, res)
})
```

### 3. Added Missing Storage Function
Added `removeClients()` function to `src/utils/localStorage.js` to fix the database seeding script error.

## Results

### Before Fix
```bash
$ curl https://abco-erp-2-production.up.railway.app/api/projects
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
...
```

### After Fix
```bash
$ curl https://abco-erp-2-production.up.railway.app/api/projects
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Unauthorized"
  }
}
```

Now all API endpoints return proper JSON responses (including authentication errors), and the application can successfully communicate with the backend.

## Files Modified
1. `server-production.js` - Added dynamic API routing logic
2. `src/utils/localStorage.js` - Added `removeClients()` function
3. `api/projects.js` - Added debugging logs
4. `server.js` - Added debugging logs

## Testing
All API endpoints now return JSON:
- ✅ `/api/health` - Returns status JSON
- ✅ `/api/projects` - Returns JSON (auth required)
- ✅ `/api/leads` - Returns JSON (auth required)
- ✅ `/api/invoices` - Returns JSON (auth required)
- ✅ `/api/time-entries` - Returns JSON (auth required)
- ✅ `/api/clients` - Returns JSON (auth required)
- ✅ `/api/users` - Returns JSON (auth required)

## Deployment
Changes deployed to Railway production environment on October 20, 2025.
