# Cursor Rules for Abcotronics ERP

## Primary Application Code Locations

The REAL application code that runs in production is located in:
- `src/` - React components, styles, utilities
- `api/` - Backend API endpoints
- Root level: `index.html`, `server.js`, `package.json`

## DO NOT Edit

- `frontend/` directory - This is a separate modernization project with placeholder code
- Files in `frontend/` are NOT used by the live application

## When Editing Components

Always edit files in `src/components/` not `frontend/src/components/`

Example:
- ✅ Correct: `src/components/projects/MonthlyDocumentCollectionTracker.jsx`
- ❌ Wrong: `frontend/src/components/projects/MonthlyDocumentCollectionTracker.jsx`

## Development Server

For local development of the real app, use:
- `npm run dev:backend` - Starts Express server serving the real app
- `npm run watch:jsx` - Watches and builds JSX files from `src/`

The `npm run dev` command starts both the real app AND the frontend modernization project. If you only need the real app, use `npm run dev:backend`.

## File Verification

Before editing, verify:
1. File path starts with `src/` or `api/` (not `frontend/`)
2. File is referenced in the build process or loaded by the server
3. Changes appear when testing with `npm run dev:backend`
