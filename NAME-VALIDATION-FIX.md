# Name Validation Fix

## Issue
Error: "Failed to save project: name required"

## Root Cause
The form was being submitted without properly validating that the `name` field had a value before sending to the API.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Client-Side Validation in ProjectModal
Added validation in `src/components/projects/ProjectModal.jsx` to check if name field is empty before submission:
```javascript
// Validate name field
if (!formData.name || formData.name.trim() === '') {
    console.error('❌ Project name is required but empty');
    alert('Please enter a project name');
    return;
}
```

### 2. API-Side Validation in Projects.jsx
Added validation in `src/components/projects/Projects.jsx` to check if projectData has a name before processing:
```javascript
// Validate required fields
if (!projectData || !projectData.name || projectData.name.trim() === '') {
    console.error('❌ Invalid project data:', projectData);
    alert('Project name is required');
    return;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to help debug issues:
- Form data being submitted
- Validation checks
- What data is being sent to the API

## Testing
Now when you try to create a project:

1. **If name is empty**: You'll get an alert "Please enter a project name" immediately
2. **If name is filled**: The project will be created successfully

## What to Do Now
1. Refresh the browser to load the updated code
2. Try creating a project again
3. Make sure to fill in the "Project Name" field
4. Check the browser console for detailed logs
