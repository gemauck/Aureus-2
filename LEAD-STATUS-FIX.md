# Lead Status Persistence Fix - Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Status changes not persisting on refresh**
   - Status and stage were being saved to database
   - But LiveDataSync was refetching data and sometimes overwriting local state
   - Race condition between auto-save and parent component updates

2. **Missing stage field in create operation**
   - Stage field was in schema and update operations
   - But wasn't included in the create lead operation

## Changes Made

### 1. API Layer (`api/leads.js`)

**Added stage field to create operation:**
```javascript
stage: String(body.stage || 'Awareness').trim(),
```

**Enhanced update logging:**
- Added detailed logging for status and stage fields
- Log before and after database update
- Removed `type: 'lead'` from WHERE clause (redundant, using id is sufficient)

### 2. Client Component (`Clients.jsx`)

**Enhanced handleSaveLead:**
```javascript
// Explicitly preserve critical fields
const updatedLead = { 
    ...selectedLead, 
    ...leadFormData,
    status: leadFormData.status,
    stage: leadFormData.stage
};

// Add database refresh after save
setTimeout(() => {
    loadLeads();
}, 500);
```

### 3. Database Schema

**Schema already correct:**
- Stage field exists in Client model
- Default value: 'Awareness'
- Migration already applied

**Created SQL verification script:** `ensure-stage-field.sql`
- Sets default stage for any NULL/empty stages
- Verifies data integrity
- Counts leads by stage

## Testing Steps

### 1. Verify Database Schema
```bash
cd /Users/gemau/Documents/Project\ ERP/abcotronics-erp-modular
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db < ensure-stage-field.sql
```

### 2. Test Status Changes
1. Open a lead in detail view
2. Change status from "Potential" to "Active"
3. Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Verify status is still "Active"

### 3. Test Stage Changes
1. Open a lead in detail view  
2. Change stage from "Awareness" to "Interest"
3. Hard refresh the page
4. Verify stage is still "Interest"

### 4. Test Pipeline View
1. Go to Pipeline view
2. Drag a lead to a different stage
3. Hard refresh the page
4. Verify lead is in the new stage

### 5. Check Browser Console
Look for these log messages:
```
=== SAVE LEAD DEBUG ===
Lead status from form: Active
Lead stage from form: Interest
🔄 Updated lead object: {id: "...", status: "Active", stage: "Interest"}
🌐 Calling API to update lead: ...
🌐 Payload to API: {status: "Active", stage: "Interest"}
✅ Lead updated in database
✅ Updated lead status: Active
✅ Updated lead stage: Interest
```

### 6. Check API Logs (Terminal/Server)
```bash
# If running locally
npm run dev

# Look for:
🔍 Updating lead with data: { ... status: 'Active', stage: 'Interest' ... }
🔍 Update data contains status: Active
🔍 Update data contains stage: Interest
✅ Lead updated successfully: clxxxx
✅ Updated lead status: Active
✅ Updated lead stage: Interest
```

## Key Files Modified

1. **`api/leads.js`**
   - Added stage to create operation
   - Enhanced logging
   - Fixed WHERE clause in update

2. **`src/components/clients/Clients.jsx`**
   - Enhanced handleSaveLead with explicit field preservation
   - Added database refresh after save

3. **`ensure-stage-field.sql`** (NEW)
   - Database verification script

## Database Fields for Lead Status

### Client Table Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Client" (
    "id" TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "type" TEXT NOT NULL,              -- 'client' or 'lead'
    "status" TEXT DEFAULT 'active',     -- 'Potential', 'Active', 'Disinterested'
    "stage" TEXT DEFAULT 'Awareness',   -- 'Awareness', 'Interest', 'Desire', 'Action'
    "industry" TEXT DEFAULT 'Other',
    ...
);
```

### Status Values (for leads)
- **Potential**: New lead, not yet engaged
- **Active**: Currently engaging with lead
- **Disinterested**: Lead not interested, archived

### Stage Values (AIDIA Framework)
- **Awareness**: Lead knows about company
- **Interest**: Lead shows engagement
- **Desire**: Lead wants solution
- **Action**: Ready to purchase
- **Closed Won**: Successfully converted
- **Closed Lost**: Opportunity lost

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, revert these files:

```bash
git checkout HEAD -- api/leads.js
git checkout HEAD -- src/components/clients/Clients.jsx
```

## Additional Notes

- **LiveDataSync**: The fix ensures local state is updated immediately, then refreshes from database to maintain consistency
- **Race Conditions**: The 500ms delay before refresh gives the database time to commit changes
- **Auto-save**: Changes in LeadDetailModal trigger immediate saves with explicit field preservation
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging added for debugging future issues

## Success Criteria

✅ Status changes persist after hard refresh  
✅ Stage changes persist after hard refresh  
✅ Pipeline drag-and-drop persists  
✅ No console errors  
✅ Database contains correct values  
✅ LiveDataSync doesn't overwrite changes
