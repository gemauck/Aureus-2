# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSX Transform Error
**Problem**: Compiled files were using automatic JSX transform (`import_jsx_runtime.jsx`) which requires bundling
**Solution**: Changed to classic transform using `React.createElement` for browser compatibility

### 2. Missing JavaScript Files
**Problem**: `.js` files weren't being copied to `dist/` directory
**Solution**: Updated build script to copy all `.js` files, hooks, and services to `dist/`

### 3. Browser Cache Issue
**Problem**: Browser might be caching old compiled files
**Solution**: Rebuilt from scratch to ensure all files are fresh

## Build Configuration

The build now:
- ✅ Compiles JSX to use `React.createElement` (classic transform)
- ✅ Copies all `.js` files to `dist/`
- ✅ Copies hooks directory
- ✅ Copies services directory
- ✅ Works without bundler (IIFE format)

## Clear Browser Cache

**IMPORTANT**: After rebuilding, you MUST clear your browser cache:

1. **Chrome/Edge**: 
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` on Mac)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
   - Or do hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)

2. **Firefox**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
   - Select "Cache"
   - Click "Clear Now"
   - Or hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5`

3. **Safari**:
   - Press `Cmd+Option+E` to clear cache
   - Or hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R`

## If Still Seeing Errors

If you still see "Unexpected token '<'" errors:

1. **Check server is running**: The files must be served by the Node.js server
2. **Verify file paths**: Make sure URLs in browser match actual file locations
3. **Check Network tab**: Look at the failing requests - they might be returning HTML 404 pages
4. **Restart server**: Stop and restart your Node.js server to clear any caches

## Files Rebuilt

All files have been rebuilt with the correct transform:
- ✅ All 102 JSX files compiled
- ✅ 26 utility `.js` files copied
- ✅ 1 hook file copied  
- ✅ 1 service file copied

The build is now production-ready and works without Babel Standalone!
