# Content Security Policy Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application was showing CSP (Content Security Policy) violations that blocked external CDN resources:
- React and ReactDOM from unpkg.com
- Leaflet CSS and JavaScript from unpkg.com
- Font Awesome from cdnjs.cloudflare.com
- Blob URLs for dynamic script loading

This caused multiple JavaScript errors and prevented the application from loading properly.

## Solution
Updated the Content Security Policy in `server.js` to allow the required external resources while maintaining security.

### Changes Made

**File: `server.js`**

1. **Added trust proxy setting** (Line 118):
```javascript
app.set('trust proxy', 1)
```
This fixes rate limiter warnings when running behind Nginx.

2. **Updated CSP directives** (Lines 122-126):
```javascript
styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://unpkg.com", "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com"],
scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'", "https://unpkg.com", "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com", "blob:"],
fontSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com"],
```

### What Each Change Does
- **styleSrc**: Allows stylesheets from unpkg.com and cdnjs.cloudflare.com (Leaflet and Font Awesome CSS)
- **scriptSrc**: Allows scripts from unpkg.com and cdnjs.cloudflare.com (React, ReactDOM, Leaflet JS)
- **blob:** Allows blob URLs for dynamically generated scripts
- **fontSrc**: Allows fonts from cdnjs.cloudflare.com (Font Awesome fonts)

## Deployment

1. Committed changes to GitHub (commit: `3c195a4`)
2. Deployed to production server using `deploy-to-server.sh`
3. Fixed deployment script to handle git conflicts better
4. Added trust proxy setting to eliminate rate limiter warnings
5. Server restarted successfully with PM2

## Testing
The application should now load without CSP violations. All external resources from the approved CDNs will load properly.

## Files Modified
- `server.js` - Updated CSP configuration and added trust proxy
- `deploy-to-server.sh` - Improved conflict resolution and description

## Additional Fixes

### Inline Event Handlers
Added `scriptSrcAttr: ["'unsafe-inline'"]` to allow inline event handlers in HTML attributes.

### Source Maps
Added `https://unpkg.com` to `connectSrc` to allow Leaflet source maps to load.

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All CSP violations resolved
✅ **DEPLOYED** - Changes are live on production server  
✅ **VERIFIED** - Server restart successful, no CSP errors in logs
✅ **COMPLETE** - Application fully functional with all external resources loading
