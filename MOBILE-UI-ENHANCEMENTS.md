# Mobile UI Enhancements

## Overview
Comprehensive mobile UI improvements for tables, forms, and boxes/cards to make the app much more usable on mobile devices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Mobile CSS (`mobile-optimizations.css`)

#### Table to Card Conversion
- Automatically converts HTML tables to mobile-friendly card layouts
- Tables are hidden on mobile when card versions are available
- Small tables (3 or fewer columns) in modals remain as tables for better UX
- Card styling includes:
  - Touch-friendly tap targets
  - Clear label-value pairs
  - Action buttons at the bottom
  - Dark mode support

#### Form Improvements
- **Inputs**: Minimum 52px height, 16px font size, 16px padding (prevents iOS zoom)
- **Labels**: 15px font size, bold, better spacing
- **Checkboxes/Radios**: 28px size (much larger, easier to tap)
- **Selects**: Custom styled dropdowns with arrow icons
- **Focus states**: Clear blue borders with shadow
- All form elements override small text classes (`text-xs`, `text-sm`)

#### Box/Card Improvements
- Increased padding: 20px (was variable)
- Better margins: 16px between cards
- Larger border radius: 16px for modern look
- Improved shadows for depth
- Dark mode support

### 2. Mobile Table Converter (`src/utils/mobileTableConverter.js`)

JavaScript utility that automatically:
- Detects tables on the page
- Converts table rows to card layouts on mobile (≤768px width)
- Preserves action buttons and special formatting
- Handles dynamically added tables via MutationObserver
- Removes cards when switching back to desktop
- Skips small tables in modals (keeps them as tables)

### 3. Integration

- Added script tag in `index.html` to load the converter
- CSS is already loaded via existing `mobile-optimizations.css` link
- Works automatically on page load and for dynamically added content

## How It Works

1. **On Page Load**: Converter scans for tables and converts them to cards on mobile
2. **Table Conversion**: Each table row becomes a card with:
   - Header: First cell content (primary identifier)
   - Rows: Label-value pairs for other columns
   - Actions: Buttons extracted to bottom action bar
3. **Form Enhancement**: CSS automatically overrides all form elements to be mobile-friendly
4. **Box Enhancement**: CSS automatically improves spacing and styling of all cards/boxes

## Testing

Test on mobile device or in browser DevTools mobile view:
- Tables should convert to cards automatically
- Forms should have large, easily tappable inputs
- Boxes should have better spacing and padding
- Checkboxes/radios should be large and easy to tap

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- CSS uses `:has()` selector (with fallbacks for older browsers)
- Works on iOS and Android

## Notes

- Tables in modals with ≤3 columns stay as tables (better UX)
- Converter runs automatically, no code changes needed in components
- CSS uses `!important` to override component styles aggressively
- Dark mode is fully supported

## Future Improvements

- Add swipe gestures for table rows
- Add pull-to-refresh for table data
- Optimize for very small screens (<375px)
- Add haptic feedback on interactions (if device supports)
