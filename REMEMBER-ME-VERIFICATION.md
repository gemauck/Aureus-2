## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Automated Tests:

1. **Run Storage Test:**
   ```bash
   node test-remember-me.js
   ```
   This verifies localStorage functions work correctly.

2. **Browser Test Page:**
   Open `test-remember-me-browser.html` in your browser to:
   - Test localStorage functions
   - Verify form attributes
   - Check browser password manager detection

### Manual Browser Testing:

#### Step 1: Initial Login
1. Navigate to the login page
2. **Verify**: Email field is auto-focused (cursor should be in email field)
3. Enter your email and password
4. Ensure "Remember me" checkbox is checked
5. Click "Sign In"
6. **Verify**: Browser prompts to save password (if password saving is enabled)

#### Step 2: Verify Email Persistence
1. After successful login, logout
2. Navigate back to login page
3. **Verify**: Email field is pre-filled with your email address
4. **Verify**: Browser shows password autofill option (key icon or dropdown)

#### Step 3: Test Remember Me Unchecked
1. Uncheck "Remember me" checkbox
2. Login successfully
3. Logout and return to login page
4. **Verify**: Email field is empty (saved email was cleared)

#### Step 4: Password Manager Compatibility
Test with different password managers:

**Chrome/Safari/Firefox Native:**
- ‚úÖ Should prompt to save password after login
- ‚úÖ Should autofill credentials on next visit
- ‚úÖ Should show password icon in password field

**Extension-Based Managers (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden):**
- ‚úÖ Should detect the login form
- ‚úÖ Should offer to save credentials
- ‚úÖ Should autofill on next visit

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **HTTPS Required**: Browser password managers require HTTPS in production to save passwords securely. Test on localhost works for development.

2. **Browser Settings**: Users must have password saving enabled in their browser settings for the save prompt to appear.

3. **User Choice**: Even with perfect implementation, users can choose not to save passwords when prompted by the browser.

4. **Autofill Detection**: Browsers detect login forms automatically based on:
   - Form structure
   - Input types and names
   - Autocomplete attributes
   - Successful form submission
